# sparkify-data-engineering

### This Project is done in partial fulfillment of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Course on Data Engineering

#### Project Detail

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As a data engineer, I was asked to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. My role was to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.I was able to test my database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to me by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare my results with their expected results.

#### Project Description

In this project,I applied ny skills in  data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. In completing the project, I defined fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and wrote an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.
